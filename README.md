# DNA-Sequencing

This program Searches through the Mycoplasma genitalium
 DNA sequence for Open Reading Frames. It uses ATG as start codons and
 TAA, TAG, and TGA as stop codons. When a gene is found it prints its
 start index and its length. The ORF translation will only be printed
 for the first gene found in every offset.
